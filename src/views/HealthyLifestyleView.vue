      Participating in regular physical activities is one of the best ways you can improve your overall physical health.
      Being involved with physical activities allows your body to improve its brain health, and weight management,
      reduce the risk of diseases, and strengthen your bones and muscles. According to the World Health Organisation,
      physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable disease mortality as adults who are
      physically inactive have a 20% to 30% increased risk of death compared to adults who are living a physically
      active lifestyle.
